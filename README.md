# Keyboard.io / Model 01 Typing Tutor

This is a typing tutor for the qgmlwb layout. See http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization and https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=22183.0

It is deployed at http://tutor01.benkolera.com if you want to see it in action.

It is pretty ugly right now but it could be extended to be a graphical layout configurator (the underlaying key codes line up to the kaleidoscope constants) that could also teach you to type in the layout, which could be cool!

Drop me a line if that idea sounds interesting to you!
